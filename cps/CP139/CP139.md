### Short Summary

This proposal seeks funding from the Centrifuge DAO Treasury to secure an enterprise-level membership with the Florida Blockchain Business Association (FBBA) for $49,999. This partnership aims to enhance Centrifuge’s influence in blockchain policy advocacy, expand its network, and position it as a leader in real-world asset (RWA) tokenization within the rapidly growing blockchain ecosystem in Florida.

### High-Level Objective

To leverage FBBA’s legislative advocacy, educational outreach, and community-building initiatives to advance Centrifuge’s mission of bridging real-world assets with decentralized finance (DeFi) and fostering a more inclusive financial system.

### Background of Proposal

 The FBBA has established itself as a premier organization for blockchain advocacy, particularly in Florida, a state with an increasingly influential role in technology policy and adoption. Under the leadership of Samuel Armes, the FBBA has successfully driven initiatives such as the Anti-CBDC bill and fostered a favorable regulatory environment for blockchain innovation. By joining FBBA at the enterprise level, it will secure a board seat where I can serve as our primary ambassador, ensuring issues that are relevant to both DAOs and RWAs are heard. The Centrifuge DAO can actively contribute to shaping policies that benefit RWAs and DeFi, while also gaining access to a network of key stakeholders in one of the largest economies in the world that is also politically powerful on the national stage here in the United States. Moreover, Florida is actively enticing blockchain businesses to move their operations to the Sunshine State for tax and regulatory purposes, and it would be wise for an active contributor from our DAO to educate legislators as they craft laws.

### Description of Activity:

Secure enterprise-level membership with the FBBA.

Actively participate in FBBA’s legislative advocacy campaigns to support blockchain, attendant DAOs and RWA-friendly policies.

Leverage FBBA’s network to establish partnerships and collaborations with other blockchain businesses as well as policymakers.

Utilize FBBA’s educational platforms to promote the adoption of Centrifuge’s RWA tokenization solutions.

Represent Centrifuge at FBBA events, monthly meetings, workshops, and community-building initiatives.

### Risk Assessment:

**Risk:** Limited tangible returns on investment in the short term.

**Mitigation:** Focus on building long-term relationships and aligning with FBBA’s impactful advocacy efforts.

### Sustainability

This membership will provide long-term value by positioning Centrifuge as a leader in blockchain policy advocacy and enhancing its visibility in the United States, which is poised to become the “Crypto Capital of the World” under President Trump, his cabinet, and the 119th Congress. It is notable that many legislators at the state level in Florida go on to serve at the national level. By building relationships here in Florida first, which is already the 3rd most populous state and has the 4th largest economy in the United States (16th in the world with a GDP of $1.7T as of 2024), Centrifuge will gain access to future legislators and regulators at the federal level.

Continued engagement with FBBA activities such as attending all board meetings and participating in visits to Tallahassee will ensure ongoing benefits and a strong ROI.

### Collaborations and Partnerships

Collaboration with FBBA’s network of blockchain companies, technologists, and policymakers (there are over 5000 blockchain businesses in Florida)

Potential partnerships with businesses in Florida exploring RWA tokenization (e.g. Propy).

## Change or Improvement: 

This proposal will significantly increase Centrifuge’s visibility and influence in shaping blockchain-related policies and regulations, fostering an environment conducive to RWA adoption and innovation.

Alignment to the Mission of Centrifuge DAO: This partnership aligns with Centrifuge’s mission to bridge traditional finance with DeFi by engaging with key stakeholders and advocating for a regulatory environment that supports RWA integration.

Description of Individual/Group Seeking Funding: The enterprise level of membership offers a seat on the board of the FBBA. As an active contributor to the DAO and Centrifuge ambassador, acting as a liaison between our organizations, I would be well positioned to help shape FBBA initiatives throughout the current legislative session and the remainder of the year. In addition to myself, we will have direct access to the president and founder, Samuel Armes, who has been highly successful in getting pro-blockchain legislation passed over the last several years. I have known Sam for a number of years now and will work closely with him to help build relationships that will benefit our DAO over the long term.

### Budget:

Total Request: $49,999 of CFG tokens at the time of the proposal’s passage should the DAO vote AYE in favor of this initiative.
Breakdown: Single payment for the annual enterprise-level membership fee for FBBA.

## Measurement and Evaluation:

**KPIs:**

- Getting legislation passed on the establishment of DAOs as legal entities in the Sunshine State.
- Partnerships or collaborations established via FBBA connections.
- Increased awareness of Centrifuge’s RWA solutions among FBBA’s network and policy makers in Tallahassee, the capital of Florida.

### Delivery and Reporting:

Timeline: Membership to commence immediately upon approval and funding.
Reporting: Quarterly updates to the DAO on activities and outcomes achieved through FBBA membership during our active contributor call. If I have a conflict during any given date for our quarterly calls, I will host a meeting at an alternative time to keep the DAO apprised of my efforts working with Sam and the rest of the FBBA board.
Legal and Ethical Considerations:

All activities will comply with Centrifuge DAO’s ethical guidelines and relevant legal frameworks.
No conflicts of interest have been identified.
Milestone-Based Funding: N/A – Single payment of $49,999 for annual membership.

### Goals and Themes Alignment:

Goal(s) Supported: Advance Centrifuge’s mission by engaging in policy advocacy and expanding its ecosystem.
Theme(s) Supported: Community growth, ecosystem development, and regulatory engagement.
