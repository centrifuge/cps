## Short Summary
Proposal for a new Governance process and defining proposal types and their templates.

## High-level objective
This proposal aims to bring more clarity and transparency to our Governance process. The Governance & Coordination Group (GCG) want to provide a clear framework and process for proposers, by defining different proposal types and their Governance processes.

The different proposal types are called CPs (Centrifuge Proposals) and they are each followed by a number, indicating their type.

## Background
In our proposal to become a core group in the Centrifuge DAO, and get a mandate to formalise, coordinate and facilitate Governance processes, we promised that one of our first tasks would be to propose a clearer Governance process.

## Description of activity

### Centrifuge Proposal Principles and Guidelines

- All proposals must be aligned to the Centrifuge Mission to unlock economic opportunity by connecting people to borrow and lend money transparently and cost-effectively
- All proposals must follow their respective Governance process
- A CP must be as clear and easy to understand as possible. Any member of the community without special knowledge should be able to understand the meaning and purpose of the proposal, even if not all details
- A CP must be thorough. Relevant information or categories must not be left undefined
- The proposer must select the relevant type CP (e.g. CP-1, CP-2 etc.) and provide the information mandated by their templates
- CPs must use the baseline timing of their Governance process but can use extensions if needed. If you want to use an extension make it clear in the RFC itself and outline why you think an extension is needed
- Using the principles, process, and CP framework, anyone can create a CP at any time

### Request For Comments (RFC)

Creating an RFC is always the first step of a proposal and the off-chain governance. This is posted on the Forum and the purpose is to give the Community the opportunity to provide feedback and ask questions and gauge support for the proposal. If changes are made to the proposal, based on the feedback from the Community, they should be done in this step.

Some proposals may require longer time for discussion than others, but the minimum time an RFC should be running is 7 days. The proposer decides how long an RFC should run before moving on to a snapshot vote.

In the templates for each proposal type, there is a description of what the RFC should contain (e.g. title, content etc.) in the Forum post. All RFCs must be posted in the Centrifuge [Request for Comments section](https://gov.centrifuge.io/c/cfg-governance/request-for-comments/37) of the Forum.

### The Centrifuge Proposals Repository (PR)

All proposals must be submitted to the [Centrifuge Proposals Repository](https://github.com/centrifuge/cps) (PR) on Github which is used to log all proposals. The discussion (RFC) takes place on the Forum, and if there are any changes made to the proposal, it must happen via the PR during the RFC phase, i.e. before the proposal proceeds to a snapshot vote. 
This is to ensure that a proposal is not changed during a snapshot vote or after it has ended.
A proposal is only deemed valid, if it has been submitted to the PR.
After a proposal has been submitted, a pull request number (XXXX) will automatically be assigned - this number will be used to index the proposal and in the title of the Proposal post.

### Snapshot voting

Snapshot voting has replaced our Forum polls and is always the next step in the off-chain governance after an RFC (except for CP-2, CP-3 and CP-3.1, that do not require it). Once there has been adequate discussion of a proposal (after a minimum of 7 days) - and the proposal has been submitted to the PR - a snapshot vote must be created on [OpenSquare](https://voting.opensquare.io/space/centrifuge).

If a proposal does not require an on-chain vote, the snapshot vote will be binding (i.e. if the snapshot vote passes, the proposal passes).

Otherwise, a snapshot vote acts as an indicator for whether there is support for a proposal to proceed to an on-chain proposal.
The minimum voting time for snapshots on OpenSquare is 7 days - but the proposer could increase this to any amount of days, if they deem it necessary. This information must be communicated to the Community in the Proposal post on the Forum.
Once a proposal has moved on to a snapshot vote, a new Forum post (the Proposal post) should be created (see below). 
The outcome of the snapshot vote should also be announced in this same post.

### Proposal post

Once a proposal has moved on from the RFC (and changes made if necessary), submitted to the PR, and the snapshot vote has been created, a Proposal post must be created. The purpose of this post is to notify the community that the proposal is now final and ready to proceed.

The title of this post will be CPXXXX (YY): same title as RFC, where XXXX is the pull request number from Github and YY is the abbreviation for the proposal type, e.g. (MRF).

This post should be created in the [Proposals section](https://gov.centrifuge.io/c/cfg-governance/chain-governance/18) of the Forum.

### On-chain proposal

If a snapshot vote passes, the next step is to create an on-chain proposal if it is required (see each proposal type for whether they require it or not).

This can be done either as a Democracy Proposal (any token holder can create this) or a Council Motion (only the council can create this).

Once an on-chain proposal has been submitted (Democracy or Council), a new Forum post must be created in the [Proposals section](https://gov.centrifuge.io/c/cfg-governance/chain-governance/18) of the Forum.

The title of this Forum post should be **Council Motion XX: [same title as the RFC]** or **Democracy Proposal XX: [same title as the RFC]**, depending on how the on-chain proposal was created and where XX is the number of the on-chain proposal.

The body of the post should contain the following info:

- A brief description of the proposal with a link to both the RFC and the Proposal post
- Link to the outcome of the snapshot vote
- The Governance process going forward
- Link to Council Motion/Democracy Proposal (on Subsquare)
- Pre-image hash

If the Council Motion/Democracy Proposal passes, link to the referendum (on Subsquare) afterwards as a reply to the post, so everyone can follow the progress of the proposal. You can see an example [here](https://gov.centrifuge.io/t/council-motion-47-accept-statemint-hrmp-channel-request/4738).

### Cooling-off period

A cooling-off period is the time that must pass before a proposal can be re-submitted. 
If a proposal fails to pass a snapshot vote, the cooling-off period is 15 days (counting from when the snapshot vote was created) before a new RFC can be resubmitted.

The cooling-off period is important in order to take the feedback from the Community into account and make the necessary changes to the submitted proposal, and re-submit the RFC.


### Proposal types
We have defined the following proposal types (CPs) and assigned them each with a number.

|CP #|Proposal type|Short description|
| --- | --- | --- |
|CP-1|Request for Mandate with Funding|Seeking mandate as a group/individual within the Centrifuge DAO to enact a project/work stream|
|CP-1.1|Request for Mandate without Funding|Same as CP-1, just without initial funding|
|CP-1.2|Removal of Mandate|Removal of a groupâ€™s mandate to enact a project/work stream (CP-1)|
|CP-2|Request for Funding|Asking for funding from the Treasury|
|CP-3|Runtime Upgrades|Proposals for Runtime Upgrades|
|CP-3.1|Emergency Proposals|Emergency proposals in case of hacks, exploits, attacks, or network halt|
|CP-4|General Improvements|Any proposal type, that does not fit under any of the other CPs|
|CP-5|Centrifuge Pool Onboarding Proposal (POP)|Onboarding new pools on Centrifuge Chain|

In general, the Governance process can be divided into two parts; *off-chain* and *on-chain Governance*.

*Off-chain Governance:*
This refers to the part of the process that takes place on our Forum (Request For Comments) and OpenSquare (snapshot voting). The purpose of this is generally to get input from the Community on a proposal and gather support, before moving the proposal on-chain (if necessary - not all proposals need to be submitted on-chain in order to pass).

*On-chain Governance:*
This refers to the part of the process that takes places on the blockchain. First a proposal is created on-chain (can be done by either the public or the Council) and this is generally followed by an on-chain referendum where all token holders can vote Aye or Nay.

Some of these proposal types have different governance processes, but what they all  have in common is that they start with a post on the Forum and all CPs must be submitted to the [Centrifuge Proposals Repository](https://github.com/centrifuge/cps) on Github.

It is very important that the CP is submitted correctly. In the event of an incorrect format of a proposal, the process will need to be repeated.

Please contact the Governance & Coordination Group on the Forum or Discord ([Rhano](https://gov.centrifuge.io/u/Rhano) or [ImdioR](https://gov.centrifuge.io/u/imdior)), if you have any questions regarding the process.
