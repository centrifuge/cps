# CP-1 (MRF): Request for Mandate with Funding

A mandate can be interpreted as an entity (group or individual) being given the authority by the DAO to pursue the stated objectives. The entity takes on the responsibility of fulfilling the mandate and accepts accountability to the DAO over this. 

Work can be initiated and brought to the DAO without a mandate, but no individual or group may claim to be working on behalf of the DAO without a mandate. 

A mandate indicates long term commitment (i.e. not a one time service, like creating a video for a specific purpose) and hence on-going funding. The maximum funding period is 6 months. This means that every 6 months, the group or individual would need to re-apply for funding by submitting a CP-2.

### GOVERNANCE PROCESS

|STEP|DESCRIPTION|DURATION|
| --- | --- | :---: |
|1|Create an RFC on the [Forum](https://gov.centrifuge.io/c/cfg-governance/request-for-comments/37) (see template below for title, tags and content)|Minimum 7 days|
|2|Submit proposal to the [Centrifuge Proposals Repository](https://github.com/centrifuge/cps) (on Github) to get a pull request #|-|
|3|Create a snapshot vote on [OpenSquare](https://voting.opensquare.io/space/centrifuge)|Minimum 7 days|
|4|Create a Proposal post on the [Forum](https://gov.centrifuge.io/c/cfg-governance/chain-governance/18)|-|

If the snapshot vote passes (majority of CFG votes in favor of giving the mandate), the proposal has passed and the mandate has been obtained. 

The next step is the funding process, which will be an on-chain Treasury Proposal, voted on by the Council.

# CP-1.1 (MR) Mandate Request without Funding

Same as CP-1, just without funding (i.e. no step 5 and Budget does not need to be specified in the RFC).

A group can make a proposal for seeking a mandate for a specific project/work stream and then afterwards apply for funding using a CP-2.

# CP-1.2 (REM) Removal of Mandate

In order to revoke a mandate from a group, or individual in a group, a CP-1.2 proposal has to be created.

This can happen in two ways:

1) *The group/individual itself no longer wants its mandate within the DAO*
2) *The Community/DAO wants to revoke the mandate of a group/individual in a group*

The group itself has autonomy to include and remove members, but in the case that someone breaks the Code of Conduct (forthcoming), the DAO can propose to remove a group member from the group. 

### GOVERNANCE PROCESS

1) *The group/individual itself no longer wants its mandate within the DAO*

|STEP|DESCRIPTION|DURATION|
| --- | --- | :---: |
|1|Create a Proposal post (still a CP-1.2) on the [Forum](https://gov.centrifuge.io/c/cfg-governance/chain-governance/18) with an explanation of the revocation of the mandate|-|
|2|Submit proposal to the [Centrifuge Proposals Repository](https://github.com/centrifuge/cps) (on Github)|-|

Once the announcement has been made, and the proposal has been submitted to the Centrifuge Proposals Repository, the group has automatically been revoked of its mandate. 

2) *The Community/DAO wants to revoke the mandate of a group/individual in a group*

|STEP|DESCRIPTION|DURATION|
| --- | --- | :---: |
|1|Create an RFC on the [Forum](https://gov.centrifuge.io/c/cfg-governance/request-for-comments/37) (see template below for title, tags and content)|Minimum 7 days|
|2|Submit proposal to the [Centrifuge Proposals Repository](https://github.com/centrifuge/cps) (on Github)|-|
|3|Create a snapshot vote on [OpenSquare](https://voting.opensquare.io/space/centrifuge)|Minimum 7 days|
|4|Create a Proposal post on the [Forum](https://gov.centrifuge.io/c/cfg-governance/chain-governance/18)|-|

If the snapshot vote passes (majority of CFG votes to revoke the mandate), the group/individual will no longer have its mandate.
