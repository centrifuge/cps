**Short Summary:**
This proposal seeks $164,250 in funding from the Centrifuge DAO Treasury–distributed across two major milestones with each milestone being broken into smaller payment tranches–to support ADE (Activos Digitales Estandarizados) in developing a tokenization platform for certificates of deposit (CDs) in El Salvador. ADE has established relationships with El Salvador’s regulatory bodies and state banks, positioning it uniquely to tokenize the $6 billion CD market, driving significant Total Value Locked (TVL) to Centrifuge.

ADE is collaborating with Innowise, a specialized European blockchain development firm, to build the MVP and integrate with Centrifuge. This project expands the Real-World Asset (RWA) ecosystem by bringing institutional-grade financial instruments into DeFi, establishing Centrifuge as the premier blockchain for regulated financial tokenization in Latin America.

**High-Level Objective:**
To develop a tokenization platform that enables the digitization and tokenization of El Salvador’s certificates of deposit, facilitating their integration into decentralized finance (DeFi) on Centrifuge, while establishing a long-term strategic partnership between ADE and the Centrifuge team and DAO for further financial product innovations. This initiative aligns with Centrifuge’s multi-chain EVM vision, ensuring integration with the largest pools of on-chain liquidity, developer tooling, and institutional investors, positioning Centrifuge as the go-to blockchain for financial tokenization.

**Background of Proposal:**

El Salvador’s banking system holds over $6 billion in CDs–the savings vehicle of choice–yet these instruments are illiquid and restricted to traditional finance. ADE, a newly created digital asset company in El Salvador, is collaborating with state banks to create a tokenized Certificates of Deposit (CDTs), offering:

* Liquidity & Composability: CDs become tradable financial assets in DeFi.
* Institutional Adoption: ADE is working directly with regulatory bodies and banks, ensuring compliance and seamless on-ramping.
* Tax Efficiency: Under El Salvador’s Digital Asset Law, tokenized CDs benefit from favorable tax treatment, incentivizing adoption.

To unlock this opportunity, ADE must first develop a Proof of Concept (POC), followed by a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). The requested funding will cover the costs of development, regulatory coordination, and integration with Centrifuge–with a vision for long-term collaboration between ADE and Centrifuge.

**Description of Activity:**

* Development of a proof of concept (POC) to demonstrate the feasibility of tokenized CDs on Centrifuge.
* Engagement with El Salvador’s regulators and private banks to refine the technical and legal framework + middleware architecture integration with banks core systems.
* Iterative development leading to a minimum viable product (MVP) that will facilitate the issuance of the digital asset commercial license approval, in order to start tokenizing institutional banks’ CDs through Centrifuge blockchain technology.
* Long-term partnership discussions between ADE and Centrifuge to scale the initiative and introduce additional DeFi primitives in El Salvador.

**Risk Assessment:**

* **Regulatory Uncertainty:**
While El Salvador is progressive in its digital asset policies, regulatory approvals are still required.
  * *Mitigation*: ADE is working directly with state banks and regulators to ensure compliance.

Bank’s due diligence on becoming an official bank supplier takes a lot of time, causing delays on architecture integration

* *Mitigation*: ADE has been in multiple conversations with bank stakeholders, and was actually responsible for updating the bank’s legal requirements to be official digital asset providers. Plus, ADE will use sandbox environments to allow banks to test the platform before full integration, reducing perceived risks and onboarding time.

* **Technical Development Risks:**
Delays or challenges in software development may arise.
  * *Mitigation*: Innowise is a highly experienced development firm with a proven track record within blockchain products in the institutional financial sector. Development follows an Agile methodology, ensuring iterative testing, faster issue resolution, and adaptive project management. Parallel testing and modular deployment will be implemented, allowing different components (e.g., OnchainID, Private Data Layer, Custodial Wallet) to be tested independently, reducing risk bottlenecks.

 **Adoption Risks:**
State banks and depositors may be slow to adopt tokenized CDs.
  * *Mitigation:* The POC and MVP will demonstrate the benefits of tokenization to key stakeholders, especially in light of the tax free laws around digital assets in El Salvador. At the same time, the MVP will include a real-world test phase where select institutions can pilot tokenized CDs under controlled conditions. ADE also plans to help banks promote CDTs through mutual marketing campaigns + educational workshops and regulatory briefings with bank executives, legal teams, and institutional investors to increase adoption confidence. 
  
  **Security Risks:**
Smart contract vulnerabilities or security breaches
  * *Mitigation:* The platform will undergo multiple independent security audits before full deployment. Only battle-tested smart contract standards will be used. To mitigate risks from the banking side, ADE will implement tamper-proof digital footprints to track all interactions, making unauthorized changes impossible. Additionally, ADE’s infrastructure will ensure that even in the event of a breach, banks will maintain full transparency and immutable transaction records, eliminating the possibility of undetected hacks originating from ADE’s platform. Immutable transaction records will be stored on-chain, providing full auditability and preventing undetected fund mismanagement.

**Sustainability:**

* ADE’s long-term vision includes rolling out additional tokenized RWAs + DeFi products beyond CDs - ensuring continuous growth in adoption and TVL.
* Once the MVP is successfully deployed, the platform will generate transaction fees on the issuance, transfer, and trading of tokenized CDs reducing the need for further DAO funding.

**Collaborations and Partnerships:**

* ADE is directly working with El Salvador’s regulators + private & state banks to introduce tokenized CDs.
* Innowise, a Poland-based software development firm, will build the tokenization infrastructure on Centrifuge.
* Centrifuge DAO will play a key role in funding and technical guidance to ensure successful integration.
* GlobalStake is an institutional focused, enterprise grade, SOC2 Type II certified bare metal blockchain infrastructure company. Their legal team is engaged in the process of creating an El Salvador business entity to provide RPC endpoints and other necessary hardware to ensure the ADE project connects seamlessly to Centrifuge (GS currently runs an RPC for Centrifuge for free under their community label, Lucky Friday).
* GK8, an institutional-grade custody technology provider, is the main candidate to provide multi-party computation (MPC) wallet infrastructure.
* Torres Legal, a prominent legal advisory firm in El Salvador, who specializes in blockchain and digital assets law, are advising ADE. Torres has actively participated in shaping the country's digital asset regulatory framework, including involvement in panels on digital assets and the Digital Asset Issuance Law.

**Change or Improvement:**

* Introduces a major new RWA category on Centrifuge, significantly increasing TVL.
* Establishes Centrifuge as a go-to platform for financial institutions exploring blockchain solutions.
* Strengthens Centrifuge’s presence in Latin America, a region increasingly adopting blockchain innovations.

**Alignment to the Mission of Centrifuge DAO:**

* **Real-World Asset Expansion:** This project aligns with Centrifuge’s goal of integrating RWAs into DeFi.
* **Strategic Growth:** ADE’s roadmap includes additional DeFi products beyond CDs, providing long-term benefits to Centrifuge DAO.
* **Regulatory Engagement:** Working with state banks and regulators ensures that Centrifuge remains compliant while expanding its institutional footprint.

**Description of Group(s) Seeking Funding:**

* **ADE (Standard Digital Assets):** A digital asset firm in El Salvador specializing in financial innovation and blockchain applications.
* **Innowise:** A European software development company with expertise in blockchain infrastructure in institutional financial enterprises.
* **Centrifuge DAO Governance Voters / TAG:** Will oversee the grant and ensure alignment with DAO objectives.
