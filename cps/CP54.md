## About this proposal

Upgrade Centrifuge Chain to Runtime Version 1019

### List of content of this Runtime Upgrade

* Add block rewards as proposed in [CP6](https://github.com/centrifuge/cps/blob/main/cps/CP6.md) ([#1198](https://github.com/centrifuge/centrifuge-chain/pull/1198), [#1342](https://github.com/centrifuge/centrifuge-chain/pull/1342))
  * Time-wise, rewarding is tightly coupled to sessions (6h in block time) in contrast to epochs (12h) from CP6. Thus, the proposed amounts are halved and rewarded in 6 hour periods
  * Collator rewards = `16.65 CFG per collator per epoch / 2 sessions per epoch = 8.325 CFG = 8325 * MILLI_CFG` per collator
  * Total rewards = `20,096 CFG per epoch / 2 sessions per epoch = 10048 CFG`
  * Treasury rewards = Total rewards - Collator rewards
* Add EVM wallet support ([#1252](https://github.com/centrifuge/centrifuge-chain/pull/1252), [#1349](https://github.com/centrifuge/centrifuge-chain/pull/1349))
  * Until we enable full EVM support soon™️, the production runtimes filter all non-root calls to the EVM pallet and disallow creating contracts via the EVM RPC calls
* Upgrade to Polkadot v0.9.37 ([#1241](https://github.com/centrifuge/centrifuge-chain/pull/1241))

### Breaking changes

* Loans: LoanId out from ActiveLoan ([#1367](https://github.com/centrifuge/centrifuge-chain/pull/1367))
* Loans: Add unchecked amount support by ([#1368](https://github.com/centrifuge/centrifuge-chain/pull/1368))
* Loans: Add multiple triggers for write-offs ([#1314](https://github.com/centrifuge/centrifuge-chain/pull/1314))
* Loans: Adapt to Oracle valuation implementation ([#1311](https://github.com/centrifuge/centrifuge-chain/pull/1311))

### Migrations

This upgrade includes multiple smaller migrations.

* Block rewards: Sets up the required block rewards storage for our current collators. ([#1342](https://github.com/centrifuge/centrifuge-chain/pull/1342))
  * Without this migration, none of the collators would be eligible to claim rewards.
* Block rewards base: Mints `ExistentialDeposit` worth `1 µCFG` to the sovereign account of the `BlockRewardsBase` ([#1342](https://github.com/centrifuge/centrifuge-chain/pull/1342))
  * Without this migration, not all rewards can be claimed from the reward recipients.
* Session: Clones the existing `AuRa` session keys for every collator to the new `block_rewards` entry of `SessionKeys` ([#1342](https://github.com/centrifuge/centrifuge-chain/pull/1342))
  * Without this migration, all of our collators would have to update their session keys manually. E.g., none of the collators would actually be recognized by the session transition inside `pallet_block_rewards` because the `block_rewards` entry of `SessionKeys` is unset.
* Loans: Updates the `WriteOffPolicy` storage as a result of [#1314](https://github.com/centrifuge/centrifuge-chain/pull/1314)
* Asset registry: Sets the `AssetMetadata.location` of all the Tranche tokens registered in the `AssetRegistry` to `None` ([#1340](https://github.com/centrifuge/centrifuge-chain/pull/1340))
* EVM: Sets our parachain ID `2031` as our EVM chain id ([#1349](https://github.com/centrifuge/centrifuge-chain/pull/1349))
