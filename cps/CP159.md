## About this proposal

* Fixes Council back to the state of CP136 ([ref](https://gov.centrifuge.io/t/cp136-resetting-the-centrifuge-council/6648))

* Prepares the clearing of the Elections Phragmen Pallet by removing all votes and unlocking the corresponding balance
* In the next RU, we will then remove the pallet which used to be the source of truth for the Council. However, since switching to the fixed Council, this pallet is no longer necessary
* Fixes XCM weights such that `xcm.send` works again, which was blocked by weights that exceeded the maximum block weight
* Applies fixes from Cantina Liquidity Pools Audit Competition ([ref](https://cantina.xyz/competitions/a0a58a8b-247e-4203-b3cb-476ded9d5515))


 ```Please note:```
The WASM was not released publicly to mitigate potential threats. We will perform a public release when the RU is applied.
