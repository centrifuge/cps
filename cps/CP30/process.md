# POP - Process

## Stage 1 - Present

1.1 Applicant Introduction (Optional): An opportunity for the applicant to introduce themselves and tell their story in a less formal post shared with the Community.

1.2 POP Post: The applicant submits their POP through the Forum for review, discussion, and consideration by the Credit Group. An informal intro on the Centrifuge Forum could inform the community of your impending POP, potentially leading to better discussion and engagement, and we hope you will take this opportunity to do so.

Before the Credit Group reviews the submitted POP (Stage 2), a Forum moderator reviews their submission to ensure it is complete, the criteria are entered correctly, and then provides a brief summary of the main points. A Forum discussion can occur in advance of the Credit Group Report.

## Stage 2 - Review

2.1 Credit Group Report (Optional): The Credit Group has the option to engage directly with the applicant, review the POP, and then share a report with the community.

2.2 Pool Party (Optional): A Pool Party is an option to be hosted by the applicant before the next steps to generate excitement and engage the Centrifuge Community through a conference call.

## Stage 3 - Approval

3 OpenSquare Snapshot: The POP applicant will submit their POP to Github beforehand, and the Governance & Coordination Group can facilitate if needed. It will then be submitted for an OpenSquare Snapshot vote to determine if the POP will pass.

## Stage 4 - Launch

4 Pool Launch: If the OpenSquare Snapshot vote (3) passes, the POP will launch.
