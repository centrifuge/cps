**Short Summary**

The Centrifuge DAO and CFG tokenholders secure the Centrifuge protocol, a critical infrastructure for tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), which has recently surpassed $1B in AAA-rated assets issued. To date, awareness of the CFG token and the DAO remains limited, and RWA mindshare is dominated by competitors like Ondo. This proposal seeks approval for a Q4 2025 pilot marketing program designed to increase visibility and understanding of CFG and the DAO, engage tokenholders, and provide ongoing opportunities for participation.

### **High-Level Objective**

To raise awareness of the CFG token and Centrifuge DAO among the wider crypto and RWA communities, strengthen the narrative around the DAO’s role, and provide measurable insights to inform a broader marketing strategy.

### **Background**

Centrifuge has accelerated the on-chain adoption of tokenized assets and solidified its position in the RWA ecosystem. Despite this growth, the CFG token and the DAO lack a clear, easy-to-understand narrative. Current awareness and participation remain low, while competitors such as Ondo dominate public perception of the RWA market. Increasing visibility and engagement for the DAO is critical to sustaining Centrifuge’s leadership and fostering adoption of its ecosystem.

### **Description of Activity**

The proposed Q4 2025 pilot will focus on a mix of owned, paid, and earned media opportunities to educate the market and highlight ways for tokenholders to engage with the DAO. Activities include:

* **Strategy and oversight:** Jana Bertram

* **Community content creation:** ImdioR

* **Co-amplification with Centrifuge marketing team:** Mariia

* **DAO liaison and spending oversight:** Kate

* **Supporting creative & execution:** Ad hoc designer & marketing coordinator (TBA)

The pilot will run for the quarter and serve as a testbed to optimize content, channels, and messaging, providing data to inform a long-term strategy.

### **Change or Improvement**

If approved, this pilot will:

* Increase public awareness of CFG and the DAO

* Educate tokenholders on ways to participate and stay informed

* Establish a repeatable framework for marketing initiatives

* Generate data for measuring engagement, reach, and ROI, guiding future campaigns

### **Budget**

The total proposed budget is $55,000 USD, payable in CFG. This covers fees for paid partnerships and resources needed to execute the pilot program effectively. The amount is to be sent to a designated multisig, which the task force will manage. With the actual CFG token price, the requested amount is 171,875 CFG.

Cost breakdown:

| KOLs (~4 over 3 months)      | 25,000 |
|------------------------------|--------|
| Sponsorships (1-2)           | 13,000 |
| Design & Content (CFG landing page + content templates) | 5,000  |
| Marketing coordinator (4 months) | 12,000 |

### **Alignment to the Mission of Centrifuge DAO**
By improving awareness of CFG and the DAO, this pilot strengthens the protocol’s security and governance through informed and engaged tokenholders. Enhanced visibility will support Centrifuge’s mission to accelerate the on-chain adoption of RWAs, reinforce its leadership in the ecosystem, and ensure sustainable growth for both the protocol and its community.
