# CP-3 (RU) Runtime Upgrades 

CP-3 is used to propose Runtime Upgrades. Runtime Upgrades allow developers and community members to change the logic of the chain, or parameter for pallets, without the need for a hard fork.

Runtime Upgrades may contain previously passed CP-4s (General Improvements) - this will be specified in the Proposal post.

#  CP-3.1 (EP) Emergency Proposals

CP-3.1 is used to propose emergency proposals in order to avoid or prevent hacks, exploits, attacks, or network halts.

In order to protect the protocol, some actions or changes may take place without prior notice (Council motions + referenda).

When/if the Council motion and referendum have passed, and the Runtime Upgrade has been successfully enacted, a post-mortem must be posted on the Forum with a full description of the issue(s) and the fix.

Given that a public disclosure of a bug, exploit, or hack may lead to (further) exploitation of this vulnerability, all changes should take place without premature public disclosure but should be made public later in a post-mortem.

These types of proposals will be fast-tracked and the voting window in the referendum **may be as short as 3 hours**.
