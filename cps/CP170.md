## Short Summary 
This RFC proposes withdrawing the Centrifuge DAO’s 1,276,162 CFG liquidity from Hydration’s Omnipool.

## High level objective 
This proposal aims to recover the 1,276,162 CFG locked in Hydration’s Omnipool, protecting Centrifuge DAO’s assets and transferring them to Centrifuge DAO Treasury.

## Background 
Centrifuge has supported cross-chain liquidity to enhance the accessibility and utility of its governance token, CFG, within the Polkadot ecosystem. To this end, the Centrifuge DAO provided significant liquidity to the Hydration Protocol (formerly HydraDX) through two governance proposals:
CP53: Deposited 540,000 CFG into the Hydration Omnipool to boost on-chain liquidity for CFG. Link to CP53
CP102: Added 710,000 CFG, totaling 1,250,000 CFG ($595,000 at the time), to further enhance liquidity, with the DAO retaining control over the tokens. Link to CP102
The goal was to increase CFG’s liquidity, enabling token holders to buy and sell CFG easily while earning trading fees for the DAO. Over 2 years and 2 months, the Centrifuge DAO’s liquidity position grew to 1,276,162 CFG (~$229,438 at $0.18 per CFG), earning only 26,162 CFG in trading fees, which significantly underperformed the declared performance in CP53 and CP102.

On July 2nd, Hydration’s Technical Council unilaterally suspended CFG trading, as was post facto announced on X ( https://x.com/hydration_net/status/1940429154987471196) and voted on via Subsquare( https://hydration.subsquare.io/techcomm/proposals/230), without prior communication with the Centrifuge DAO. 

## Description of Activity 

This RFC proposes the immediate withdrawal of the Centrifuge DAO’s 1,276,162 CFG from Hydration’s Omnipool and the reallocation of these assets to the Centrifuge DAO Treasury. 
Actions:
 - Execute the technical process to withdraw the CFG liquidity, ensuring the DAO regains control of the full 1,276,162 CFG.


## Change or improvement 
- Recover DAO Assets: Return 1,276,162 CFG to the Centrifuge DAO Treasury


## Alignment to the mission of Centrifuge DAO 
Centrifuge’s mission is to bridge real-world assets to DeFi through a transparent and accessible protocol. Withdrawing 1,276,162 CFG from Hydration, where CFG trading is suspended, protects Centrifuge DAO assets.
